# Distributed Graph Programming Project
## Objectives and deliverables
The objective of this component is to deepen the student’s knowledge of and insight in distributed graph processing. They will learn how to design, implement and finalize and present a project. They should demonstrate the following skills:

* Understanding of Pregel as a graph processing framework 
* Propose, implement and use an algorithm for the solution of graph analytical problems
* Run proposed algorithm on a real data set
* Present the results

The programming project should contain the following steps:
* Define the three components required in a Pregel implementation
* Implement in GraphX 
*	Import graph data into GraphX
*	Apply algorithm to graph data

The deliverables are: 
*	Final Report with source code on Wednesday, May 24th

## Project descriptive:
Community detection or clustering is a common problem in graph analytics. Many different approaches and algorithms are developed.

Also within the Spark-GraphX framework with its Pregel-like approach to BSP, several approaches and implementations can be found. In this project, it is the student’s task to review some of these algorithms and discuss their implementation in Pregel, their features, advantages/disadvantages and their time and space complexity.

Programming task:
1.	Implement several available Clustering or Community Detection solutions in GraphX.
2.	Run the different solutions on the given dataset and describe properties

Data set:
*	Location-based social networking website
